== 0.2.0 (2010-05-13)
  * Added support for I18n snippr files. Simply enable I18n:
    
      Snippr.i18n = true
    
    And Snippr will automatically retrieve the current locale from I18n and append
    it to every snippr file you're trying to load:
    
      I18n.locale = :de
      Snippr.load(:topup, :success) # Will load: "topup/success_de.snip"

  * From the example above, you should also notice that the method for loading a
    snippr file has changed from +new+ to +load+.

== 0.1.0 (2010-04-30)
  * Initial version.
